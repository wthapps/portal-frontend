1) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory (portal-frontend)

2) Type: `npm install`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.
    
3) Type: `npm start`
    This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. 
    It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.
    
4) Open a command prompt in the project's assets directory (portal-frontend/app/assets)
    `cd app/assets/web_tools`
    `npm install` & `bower install`
    `grunt build`


    Assets ready for use are now available in a `dist` folder
