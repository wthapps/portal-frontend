      There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with
      other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a WTH
      Account,
      we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect
      with
      people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how
      we’re
      using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Privacy Policy explains:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What information we collect and why we collect it.
      </li>
      <li>
        How we use that information.
      </li>
      <li>
        The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with <a [routerLink]="['/policies/terms']">terms</a> like cookies, IP addresses,
      pixel tags and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to WTH so whether you are
      new to WTH or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any
      questions contact us.
    </p>
    <h4>Information we collect</h4>
    <p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which
      language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to
      you online, or which YouTube videos you might like.
    </p>
    <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Information you give us.</li>
      <li>Information we get from your use of our services.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      How we use information we collect
    </h4>
    <p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to
      develop new ones, and to protect WTH and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content
      – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.</p>
    <p>We may use the name you provide for your WTH Profile across all of the services we offer that require a WTH
      Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your WTH Account so that you are represented
      consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies
      you, we may show them your publicly visible WTH Profile information, such as your name and photo.</p>
    <p>
      If you have a WTH Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on WTH or
      on third-party applications connected to your WTH Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you
      post) in our services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you
      make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your WTH Account.</p>
    <p>
      When you contact WTH, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We
      may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or
      improvements.</p>
    <p>
      We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience
      and the overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is WTH
      Analytics. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the
      language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar
      technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.</p>
    <p>
      Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features,
      such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.</p>
    <p>
      We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other
      WTH services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine
      DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.</p>
    <p>
      We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this
      Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>
      WTH processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your
      personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.</p>
